    "* We can then repeat the process with the upper half. Start at the middle item and compare it against what we are looking for. \n",

    "## 3. Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "### We can build a data structure that can be searched in O(1) time. This concept is referred to as hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The mapping between an item and the slot where that item belongs in the hash table is called the hash function. The hash function will take any item in the collection and return an integer in the range of slot names, between 0 and m-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hash Function #1 - Remainder Method\n",
    "* Assume that we have the set of integer items 54, 26, 93, 17, 77, and 31. \n",
    "* We’ve preassigned an empty hash table of m=11\n",
    "* Our remainder hash function then is: h(item)=item%11\n",
    "* Let’s see the results as a table\n",
    "\n",
    "* We’re now ready to occupy 6 out of the  11 slots.\n",
    "* This is referred to as the load factor, and is commonly denoted by λ = (numberofitems) / (tablesize).\n",
    "* For this example, λ=6/11.\n",
    "* <img src=\"Remainder1.png\">\n",
    "* Our hash table has now been loaded.\n",
    "* <img src=\"Remainder1.png\">\n",
    "* When we want to search for an item, we simply use the hash function to compute the slot name for the item and then check the hash table to see if it is present. \n",
    "* This searching operation is O(1), since a constant amount of time is required to compute the hash value and then index the hash table at that location. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hash Function #2 - Folding Method\n",
    "* The folding method for constructing hash functions begins by dividing the item into equal-size pieces (the last piece may not be of equal size). \n",
    "* These pieces are then added together to give the resulting hash value.\n",
    "* If our item was the phone number 436-555-4601\n",
    "* We would take the digits and divide them into groups of 2 (43,65,55,46,01). \n",
    "* After the addition, 43+65+55+46+01, we get 210. \n",
    "* If we assume our hash table has 11 slots, then we need to perform the extra step of dividing by 11 and keeping the remainder. \n",
    "* 210 % 11 is 1, so the phone number 436-555-4601 hashes to slot 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hash Function #3 - Mid-Square Method\n",
    "* For the mid-square method we first square the item, and then extract some portion of the resulting digits. \n",
    "* For example, if the item were 44, we would first compute 442=1,936.\n",
    "* By extracting the middle two digits, 93, and performing the remainder step, we get 93%11 =5\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-integer elements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We can also create hash functions for character-based items such as strings. The word “cat” can be thought of as a sequence of ordinal values.\n"
