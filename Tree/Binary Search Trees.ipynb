    "## Put Method\n",
    "### it will check to see if the tree already has a root. If there is not a root then put will create a new TreeNode and install it as the root of the tree.\n",
    "### If a root node is already in place then put calls the private, recursive, helper function put to search the tree according to the following algorithm…\n",
    "* Starting at the root of the tree, search the binary tree comparing the new key to the key in the current node.\n",
    "* If the new key is less than the current node, search the left subtree. If the new key is greater than the current node, search the right subtree.\n",
    "* When there is no left (or right) child to search, we have found the position in the tree where the new node should be installed.\n",
    "* To add a node to the tree, create a new TreeNode object and insert the object at the point discovered in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: Insertion of a duplicate key is handled by replacing the old value of that key with the new one. The current method ignores this duplicate subkey scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Method\n",
    "### Once the tree is constructed, the next task is to implement the retrieval of a value for a given key. \n",
    "### The get method is even easier than the put method because it simply searches the tree recursively until it gets to a non-matching leaf node or finds a matching key. \n",
    "### When a matching key is found, the value stored in the payload of the node is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deleting Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "### The first task is to find the node to delete by searching the tree. \n",
    "### If the tree has more than one node we search using the _get method to find the TreeNode that needs to be removed.\n",
    "### If the tree only has a single node, that means we are removing the root of the tree, but we still must check to make sure the key of the root matches the key that is to be deleted. \n",
    "### In either case if the key is not found the del operator raises an error.\n",
    "### Once we’ve found the node containing the key we want to delete, there are three cases that we must consider:\n",
    "* The first case is straightforward. If the current node has no children all we need to do is delete the node and remove the reference to this node in the parent.\n",
    "* The second case is only slightly more complicated. If a node has only a single child, then we can simply promote the child to take the place of its parent.\n",
    "* The third case is the most difficult case to handle. If a node has two children, then it is unlikely that we can simply promote one of them to take the node’s place. We can, however, search the tree for a node that can be used to replace the one scheduled for deletion.\n",
    "    * What we need is a node that will preserve the binary search tree relationships for both of the existing left and right subtrees. \n",
    "    * The node that will do this is the node that has the next-largest key in the tree. We call this node the successor.\n",
    "    * The successor is guaranteed to have no more than one child, so we know how to remove it using the two cases for deletion that we have already implemented. \n",
    "    * Once the successor has been removed, we simply put it in the tree in place of the node to be deleted.\n",
    "    * Notice that we make use of the helper methods findSuccessor and findMin to find the successor. \n",
    "    * To remove the successor, we make use of the method spliceOut. \n",
    "    * The reason we use spliceOut is that it goes directly to the node we want to splice out and makes the right changes.\n"
